I thought to make a horseshoe and asked my hammer thus
He said, "I'll ask the anvil what you require of us"
The hammer asked the anvil and she at once agreed
That they should meet together in the way that I decreed
And it's sparks a-flying, passion strong
I am the blacksmith singing
The hammer and the anvil song
I thought to make an anchor, for taking on the main
The hammer and the anvil relented once again
So they sat there together, as I prepared the cast
They braced themselves for impact like a sailor on the mast
And it's sparks a-flying, passion strong
I am the blacksmith singing
The hammer and the anvil song
I thought to make a broadsword, for fighting on the field
Much as I know the hammer is a nobler thing to wield
For though us humble tradesfolk choose a quiet life
The gods of war come to the door of the hammer and his wife
And it's sparks a-flying, passion strong
I am the blacksmith singing
The hammer and the anvil song
They asked me for a statue of the general who died
A sword raised in his iron fist and a warhorse sat astride
And though I knew they'd try me for what I did decide
I stuck a hammer in his fist and an anvil by his side
And it's sparks a-flying, passion strong
I am the blacksmith singing
The hammer and the anvil song
Now all you merry blacksmiths, a warning take by me
Stick to your country horseshoes and your anchors for the sea
When the gods of war come calling, promising you gold
They'll take your hammer, take your anvil, take your very soul
And it's sparks a-flying, passion strong
I am the blacksmith singing
The hammer and the anvil song
And it's sparks a-flying, passion strong
I am the blacksmith singing
The hammer and the anvil song
